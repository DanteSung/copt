C-OPT: composite optimization in Python
=======================================

Project implementing some optimization routines in Python.


Philosophy
==========

Ø compiled code. Ø bullshit. State of the art performance.

Let me explain this better:

- **Ø compiled code**, because we don't need to. `Numba <http://numba.pydata.org/>`_ generates machine-efficient code on the fly.
    
- **Ø bullshit**. Here you will only find methods that work out of the box. No more tweaking hyperparameters to make the method converge. Pinkie swear.

- **State of the art performance**. We are constantly working on making the methods as fast as possible.
